## üß† Methodology

### **Input**

* Raw dataset (`Raw_data\diabetes_dataset.csv`)
* Variables: demographic, lifestyle, biometric, and family medical history data

### **Process**

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handle missing values
   * Standardize continuous variables
   * One-hot encode categorical features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Visual correlation, clustering, and pattern recognition

3. **Modeling**

   ## üìä Linear Regression to predict BMI (proxy for diabetes risk)
   
I have used **linear regression** to model the relationship between a predictor variable and the binary outcome of being classified as **obese (1)** or **not obese (0)** based on BMI.

üìä  (Age vs BMI Category)
Title: Linear Regression: Age vs BMI Category

X-axis: age

Y-axis: bmi_category_code (numeric code: 0 = Normal, 1 = Overweight, 2 = Obese)

Observations:

The scatter plot shows three horizontal bands representing BMI categories.

The red regression line has a slight negative slope, suggesting that younger individuals tend to fall into higher BMI categories.

This may reflect lifestyle or metabolic shifts in younger populations, though the trend is weak.

The confidence interval is relatively wide, indicating low predictive strength.


üìä  (Diet Score vs BMI Category)
Title: Linear Regression: Diet Score vs BMI Category

X-axis: diet_score (higher values indicate healthier diets)

Y-axis: bmi_category_code

Observations:

The regression line slopes downward, showing a negative association: individuals with higher diet scores are more likely to be in lower BMI categories.

This aligns with nutritional science ‚Äî healthier diets are associated with lower obesity risk.

The confidence interval is tighter than in the age plot, indicating moderate predictive strength.



üìä (Glucose Ratio vs BMI Category)
Title: Linear Regression: Glucose Ratio vs BMI Category

X-axis: glucose_ratio (postprandial / fasting glucose)

Y-axis: bmi_category_code

Observations:

The regression line slopes upward, indicating a positive association: higher glucose ratios are linked to higher BMI categories.

This supports the metabolic connection between obesity and impaired glucose regulation.

The clustering is clear, and the confidence interval is reasonably narrow ‚Äî suggesting stronger predictive value than age or diet score.

üîç Comparative Analysis
Chart	Predictor Variable	Association with BMI Category	Type of Variable	Strength of Insight
1	Age	Slight Negative	Continuous	Weak
2	Diet Score	Negative	Continuous	Moderate
3	Glucose Ratio	Positive	Continuous	Strong
üß† Key Takeaways
Glucose ratio shows the strongest linear relationship with BMI category, reinforcing its role in metabolic profiling.

Diet score provides a meaningful inverse trend, supporting its use in preventive modeling.

Age, while relevant, shows a weak and noisy association ‚Äî suggesting it may be more useful in interaction terms or nonlinear models.

All predictors are continuous, making them suitable for linear regression visualization ‚Äî but for classification tasks, ordinal regression or decision trees may yield better performance.

The use of bmi_category_code enables trend visualization across discrete BMI groups, but interpretation should remain cautious due to the ordinal nature of the target.

   ## üìä Evaluation using MSE and R¬≤


### üîπ **MSE** ‚Äì *Mean Squared Error*

- Measures the **average squared difference** between predicted and actual values.
- $$\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$
- **Smaller MSE** ‚Üí model predictions are closer to true values.
- Penalizes **larger errors more heavily** due to squaring.
- In your BMI Category regressions:
  - **Age** had a relatively high MSE ‚Üí weak predictive power.
  - **Diet Score** showed lower MSE ‚Üí stronger alignment with BMI Category.
  - **Glucose Ratio** had moderate MSE ‚Üí some predictive value, but not dominant.

---

### üîπ **R¬≤** ‚Äì *Coefficient of Determination*

- Indicates how well the model **explains the variability** of the target variable.
- $$R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{\text{res}}}{SS_{\text{tot}}}$$
- $$R^2 = 1$$ ‚Üí **Perfect fit**: model explains all variance.
- $$R^2 = 0$$ ‚Üí Model performs **no better than predicting the mean**.
- $$R^2 < 0$$ ‚Üí Model performs **worse than a constant prediction**.
- In your charts:
  - **Age vs BMI Category** had a low or slightly negative R¬≤ ‚Üí weak or no fit.
  - **Diet Score vs BMI Category** showed a **negative slope**, but R¬≤ was moderate ‚Üí meaningful trend.
  - **Glucose Ratio vs BMI Category** had a flat regression line ‚Üí low R¬≤, weak explanatory power.

## summery
- **MSE** quantifies **prediction error** ‚Äî lower values indicate better precision.
- **R¬≤** reflects **model fit** ‚Äî higher values indicate stronger relationships.
- In your case:
  - **Diet Score** showed the most interpretable trend (inverse relationship with BMI Category).
  - **Age** and **Glucose Ratio** had weaker fits, suggesting limited linear association.
- These metrics help you evaluate whether linear regression is appropriate ‚Äî and when to consider alternatives like **ordinal regression**, **decision trees**, or **logistic models** for categorical targets.



## üìê Summary: Mathematical Insights

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Goal** | **Interpretation** |
|------------|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| **MSE** *(Mean Squared Error)* | $$\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$ | Minimize | Measures average squared difference between actual and predicted values. Lower is better. |
| **R¬≤** *(Coefficient of Determination)* | $$R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{\text{res}}}{SS_{\text{tot}}}$$ | Maximize (‚â§ 1) | Measures proportion of variance in the target explained by the model. Higher is better. |

---

### üß† Interpretation

- **MSE** quantifies prediction error ‚Äî smaller values indicate more accurate predictions.
- **R¬≤** reflects model fit ‚Äî closer to 1 means the model explains more variance in the target.
- Together, they provide a balanced view:
  - **MSE ‚Üí** Precision of predictions
  - **R¬≤ ‚Üí** Strength of relationship between features and target

Outcomes:
üëâ MSE measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
Lower MSE ‚Üí better model performance.
üëâ R¬≤ measures how much of the variance in the target variable is explained by the model.
<0: model performs worse than a horizontal mean line

4. **Dashboard with power BI Visualization**
Dashboard capstone project.pbix

   * Interactive dashboards for filtering and insight generation
* Business Requirements about the dashboard.
The goal of this project is to support public health stakeholders, analysts, and decision-makers by providing interactive dashboards that:

Visualize key health indicators (e.g. BMI, glucose, physical activity, smoking, alcohol use) and their relationship to diabetes risk.

Enable demographic filtering to explore disparities across age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, education, and marital status.

Identify high-risk groups based on lifestyle and biometric factors.

Support evidence-based interventions by highlighting modifiable risk factors.

Ensure data transparency through visual summaries of missing/invalid data and robust filtering options.

* Hypotheses about dashboard 
This analysis is guided by the following hypotheses:

Higher BMI and glucose levels are positively associated with diabetes risk.

Individuals with lower physical activity and higher alcohol consumption show elevated BMI and diabetes prevalence.

Smoking history is correlated with poorer general and mental health outcomes.

Demographic factors such as age, income level, and education influence both lifestyle behaviors and diabetes risk.

There are identifiable clusters of individuals with multiple overlapping risk factors (e.g. obesity, hypertension, smoking).

üéØ Expected Outcomes
By exploring the dashboards, stakeholders should be able to:

Identify key predictors of diabetes across different population segments.

Visualize correlations between lifestyle behaviors and biometric indicators.

Detect patterns of comorbidity (e.g. obesity + hypertension + diabetes).

Prioritize intervention strategies for high-risk groups based on data insights.

Communicate findings effectively to non-technical audiences using intuitive visuals and filters.
